Description:
The automatic headlight control system is used to turn the car on detecting when the driver is in the seat. When the car is turned on it allows the headlights to be turned on. The headlights when in auto mode turn on when it gets dark. High beams are also used which can be turned on with a switch. There is a dial that allows the system to go through three states the headlights being off, the headlights being on and the headlights being controlled by the level of light detected. 




Ignition and Headlight Subsystem
Specification	Test Result	Comment
1.	Start the engine (i.e., light the blue LED) while the driverâ€™s seat is occupied and when the ignition button is pushed and then released.	Pass	
2.	Keep the engine running even if the driver should exit the vehicle.	Pass	
3.	When the engine is running, stop the engine when the ignition button is pushed (i.e., before the button is released).	Pass	
4.	When the LDR sensor is covered the headlights turn on	Pass	
5. If the ignition is not on the headlights do not work	Pass	
6. When the engine is turned off the headlights turn off.	Pass	
7. When the potentiometer is turned to on and off the LEDs are responsive	Pass	
8. Tested delay of headlights when going between dusk and light	Pass	Comments: Tested the delay in code by setting the delays to a long time for example 30 seconds. However when the delays are set to the required time it is sometimes difficult to see the delay. However the code is correct in the setting of the delay and the difficulty of the perception of the delay is probably due to outside factors
